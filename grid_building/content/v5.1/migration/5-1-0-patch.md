This patch entry documents the placement persistence change that was released as part of v5.1.0.

- Replaced `PlaceableInstance` node-based tracking with `gb_placement` metadata
- Added `GBPlacementPersistence` helper for save/load
- Migration guidance: see [Placement Persistence Guide](/v5-1/guides/placement-persistence/)

Notes:
- These changes were originally planned for a v5.0.1 patch but were included in v5.1.0 instead.
