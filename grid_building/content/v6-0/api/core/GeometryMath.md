**Project:** GridBuilding v6.0  
**Layer:** Core  
**Source:** `Core/_incomplete/Systems/Geometry/GeometryMath.cs`  
**Namespace:** `GridBuilding.Core.Systems.Geometry`  
**Parsing Method:** AST-based (Roslyn) - NOT regex

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This documentation was generated using AST parsing, not regex.
AST parsing provides accurate C# analysis while regex parsing fails on complex code.
