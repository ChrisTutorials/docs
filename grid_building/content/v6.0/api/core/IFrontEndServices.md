# IFrontEndServices

```csharp
GridBuilding.Core.Interfaces
interface IFrontEndServices
{
    // Members...
}
```

Interface for front-end services that provide engine-specific functionality.
This allows the core library to remain engine-agnostic while still accessing
necessary front-end capabilities through dependency injection.
